# Money Trail Security Headquarters

A safe working environment is essential for investigative journalists. Because journalists work with sensitive information that adversaries often prefer not to see published, training on keeping themselves, their data and their sources secure is paramount. So during the last two days of our training, Free Press Unlimited (FPU) will focus on advanced digital security techniques, including encryption, secure communication and methods to stay “under the radar” during investigations. This includes:

- **[Security of data at rest](https://security.money-trail.org/data-at-rest)**: includes resources on how to secure the **information stored** in your devices.
- **[Security of data in transit](https://security.money-trail.org/data-in-transit)**: for the security of **information exchanged with others**.
- **[Security of your devices](https://security.money-trail.org/mobile-devices)**: for the security and privacy of mobiles, laptops, tablets and the like.
- **[Social media and anti-phishing strategies](https://security.money-trail.org/social-media)**: includes resources on how to safely use social media in the course of your investigative work and interact with others securely.
- **[Generalist guides](https://security.money-trail.org/guides)**: a list of online **manuals, articles and tutorials**.
- Under **[Support](https://security.money-trail.org/emergency-support)** you'll find resources that you might need in **emergency situations** as well as **normal situations** when you need to build yourself up to guard against potential threats in the future.
- Finally, the **[FAQ](https://security.money-trail.org/faq)** (Frenquently Asked Questions) section links to the MoneyTrail **[training material](/training-material)** and catalogues answers given to specific questions asked by trainees.
