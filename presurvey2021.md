- [x] The content of your emails
- [ ] The date and time-stamp of your emails
- [ ] The subject line of your emails
- [ ] Not sure

- [ ] https://www.dropbox.login.com/
- [ ] https://www.dorpbox.com/login
- [x] https://login.dropbox.com/
- [ ] http://www.dropbox.com/login

Check then that the login URL starts with an HTTP**S** which signals that your connection tot he website is secure (i.e. encrypted).

## You are at the airport. You need to send a confidential report to a colleague before you board a plane. The report contains information that could put people in danger. Is it safe to use the airport wifi?
- [ ] Yes, if it uses a password
- [ ] Yes, if I am in a country with strong privacy laws
- [ ] Yes, if I use a good anti-virus
- [x] Yes, if I use a form of encryption (VPN, PGP encryption, Signal, Protonmail, etc.)
- [ ] I do not know


> **Explanation:** Encryption is the only sure way to prevent people sitting in the middle (between your machine and the website you visit or the person you communicate with) from listening in. Luckily there are incresingly user-friendly encryption tools at out disposal. Our favorites are Signal, the Tor Browser, use of a VPN such as the ones provided by Greenhost.nl or the use of Protonmail -- or a combination of all the above.

## With PGP email encryption
- [x] Only the recipient can open your email

- [x] It's OK to share your public key
- [x] It's OK to share your fingerprint and key ID
- [ ] Not sure


> **Explanation:** PGP encryption is a solid encryption method though not the easiest to come by. It ensures that only the intended recipient can read and open your emails. Be aware that some information is not protected with PGP encryption and might be visible to intermediaries such as the subject line of your email, the timestamp, your email address and that of the recipient, the model of yoru machine, or even the operating system you are using. Never share your private key with anyone. You can freely share your public key (Note: fingerprint and key ID and synonymous of public key)

- [x] Using Tor
- [ ] Turning off GPS
- [ ] Turning off WiFi
- [ ] Turning off WiFi and GPS
- [ ] Turning off data, WiFi and GPS
- [x] Turning off data, WiFi, GPS and Bluetooth (Airplane mode)


> **Explanation:** Be mindful of the fact that, despite the best of precautions and with the use of a VPN or Tor, the location of mobile devices remains almost impossible to hide: as soon as they connect to the internet (whether via wifi or data) they do leave traces of their presence! The only sure way is to turn on airplane mode or -if you think you might be targeted by government -grade malware- to turn the device's power off completely.

- [x] You use end-to-end encrypted services such as Signal and Protonmail
- [x] You use strong passwords coupled with 2-Factor authentication

> **Explanation:** Encryption, whether of data in transit (VPN, end-to-end encryption with Signal, PGP email encryption) or of data at rest (full disk encryption) is the best protection even against the most sophisticated adversaries.

## What measures protect best against phishing attacks?
- [ ] The use of strong passwords
- [x] The use of 2-Factor authentication
