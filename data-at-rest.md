# SECOND-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION

> Having extra steps of authentication requires that you enter other methods of authentication on top of your usual password to log in to your accounts. This adds an extra layer of protection, like an extra lock on the door, making  your online accounts much harder to break. 

> There are many methods of authentication. Below, we list those recommended most.

### **[YubiKey](https://www.yubico.com/)**

**WHAT**: Hardware authentication device (small USB key or wireless dongle).

**USEFUL FOR**: Securing access to your most senstive accounts. To log into your account you would need to input your password then plug in or activate the device (usually a small USB key) to be able to have access.

**PLATFORM**: Works on mobile and desktop (cross-platform).

**COST**: Variable, starting around $20.

**DIFFICULTY**: Medium.

**LIMITS**: Some security keys (older models) only work on devices with a USB port. More recent models no longer require being plugged in and can be activated remotely at the push of a button.
