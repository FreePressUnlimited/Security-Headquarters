## [**Diceware Wordlist**](https://security.money-trail.org/assets/London-Sept-2018/wordlist.pdf) 
(courtedy eff.org):

Make a six-word passphrase.

Step 1: Roll five dice all at once. Note the faces that come up without looking at the wordlist yet. (On our dice, the EFF logo is equivalent to rolling a one.)

Step 2: Your results might look like this reading left to right: 4, 3, 4, 6, 3. Write those numbers down.

Step 3: Open EFF's Long Wordlist [.txt] to find the corresponding word next to 43463.

Step 4: You will find the word "panoramic." This is the first word in your passphrase, so write it down.

Step 5: Repeat steps 1-4 five more times to come up with a total of SIX words.

When you are done, your passphrase may look something like this:

panoramic nectar precut smith banana handclap

Step 6: Come up with your own mnemonic to remember your phrase. It might be a story, scenario, or sentence that you will be able to remember and that can remind you of the particular words you chose, in order. For example:

The panoramic view, as I tasted the nectar of a precut granny smith apple and banana, deserved a handclap.
