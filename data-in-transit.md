# VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORKS AND CIRCUMVENTION TOOLS

**WHAT**: A Virtual Private Network, or VPN, is a program that channels your device's internet connection through an encrypted "tunnel" which helps protect your privacy and security. A VPN can also allow you to access blocked content on your network.

**USEFUL FOR**: Protecting the privacy and security of your internet activity. Accessing blocked or censored content online.

**RECOMMENDED VPN SERVICE PROVIDERS**

Provider | Open source | Metadata collection | Anonymous sign in | Jurisdiction | Paid | Ease of use | Platform
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
[Mullvad](https://mullvad.net/en/) | Yes | No | Yes | Sweden | Yes | Good | Cross-platform
[Psiphon](https://psiphon.ca/) | Yes | No | Yes | - | Free | Good | iOS, Android, Windows


**LIMITS**: A VPN does NOT make you entirely anonymous. The services you sign on to on the internet can still figure out who you are. 
The use of a VPN does NOT eliminate the need for making sure that other security measures are in place to protect your devices and accounts.
