# VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORK

    A Virtual Private Network, or VPN, channels your device's 
    entire connection through an encrypted "tunnel" which 
    protects your privacy and security. A VPN can also allow 
    you to access blocked content. A VPN does NOT, however, 
    make you entirely anonymous. The services you sign on to 
    on the internet can still figure out who you are.

## **RECOMMENDED VPN SERVICE PROVIDERS**

Provider | Open source | Metadata collection | Anonymous sign in | Jurisdiction | Paid | Ease of use | Platform
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
[Mullvad](https://mullvad.net/en/) | Yes | No | Yes | Sweden | Yes | Easy | Cross-platform
[Psiphon](https://psiphon.ca/) | Yes | No | Yes | - | Free | Easy | iOS, Android, Windows
