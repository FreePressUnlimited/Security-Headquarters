# VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORKS AND CIRCUMVENTION TOOLS

    A Virtual Private Network, or VPN, is a program that channels your device's internet connection through an encrypted "tunnel" which helps protect your privacy and security. A VPN can also allow you to access blocked content on your netwoek. A VPN does NOT, however, make you entirely anonymous. The services you sign on to on the internet can still figure out who you are.

## **RECOMMENDED VPN SERVICE PROVIDERS**

Provider | Open source | Metadata collection | Anonymous sign in | Jurisdiction | Paid | Ease of use | Platform
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
[Mullvad](https://mullvad.net/en/) | Yes | No | Yes | Sweden | Yes | Easy | Cross-platform
[Psiphon](https://psiphon.ca/) | Yes | No | Yes | - | Free | Easy | iOS, Android, Windows


**LEARN MORE**: The use of a VPN does NOT eliminate the need for making sure that other security measures are in place to protect your devices and accounts. Security Planner's [Advanced Anonymity Guide](https://securityplanner.org/#/tool/advanced-anonymity-security-guides) provides some useful advice on ways to enhance your anonymity online.
