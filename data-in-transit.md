# EMAILING

## **[Hawkpost](https://hawkpost.co/)**

**PLATFORM**: Cross-platform

**COST**: Free

**DIFFICULTY**: Easy (provided recepient is up and running with PGP)

**LEARN MORE** about how PGP encryption works on [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y2pVn8xi0Y&t=4s).











# MESSAGING

## **[Signal](https://signal.org/)**

**PLATFORM**: iPhone, Android and desktop, cross-platform

**COST**: Free

***DIFFICULTY**: Easy
