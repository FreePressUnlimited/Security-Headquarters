# BROWSING

## **[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/)** 

**WHAT**: Privacy-enhancing search engine and browser for mobile and desktop.

**USEFUL FOR**: Making private searches and browsing online. Good alternative to Google, Bink and other commercial search engines that harvest user data.

**PLATFORM**: [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/duckduckgo-privacy-browser/id663592361?mt=8), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duckduckgo.mobile.android&hl=en), website and cross-platform [browser add-on](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/duckduckgo-privacy-essent/bkdgflcldnnnapblkhphbgpggdiikppg).

**COST**: Free.

**DIFFICULTY**: Easy.

**LIMITS**: Using a privacy-enhancing search engine will NOT make you anonymous as it does not protect you against tracking by your internet service provider or some governments. 

**LEARN MORE**: Security Planner's [Advanced Anonymity Guide](https://securityplanner.org/#/tool/advanced-anonymity-security-guides) provides some useful advice on ways to enhance your anonymity online.

# MESSAGING

When choosing a messaging tool, make sure they meet your security and privacy requirements. Access Now [recommends](https://accessnowhelpline.gitlab.io/community-documentation/141-Secure_Chat_Mobile.html) looking at the following features in any messaging tool:

* **Whether it is open source**: Open source means that the building blocks of the software behind the tool can be vetted by the security community.
* **Existence of default end-to-end encryption**: The message is transmitted and stored in encrypted format in the servers of the company. This reduces the risk of interception significantly.
* **Whether it offers group chat**.
* **What encryption protocol it uses**: Some encryption protocols such as Signal and other ones developped based on it (such as Proteus, OMEMO) are trusted because they have been tested by the security community and proved to be solid.
* **Whether it offers an anonymous sign up option**: The possibity of anonymous sign up (by signing up directly via the app or via email) can be highly useful to, for instance, establish communication with a source.
* **Whether it offers the option of self-destructing messages and remote message deletion**.
* **Whether it collects metadata**: Some of the tools that offer end-to-end encryption can still collect metadata. Metadata can reveal a lot about conversations meant to remain private.
* **Whether it is a paid or free service**.
* **What jurisdiction the company falls under**.
* **Whether it can be self-hosted**: Self-hosting a messaging tool provides greater control over the communication process and eliminates vulnerabilities caused by any third party.
* **How easy i it to use** (a.k.a. usability).

The following table compiled by [Access Now](https://accessnowhelpline.gitlab.io/community-documentation/141-Secure_Chat_Mobile.html) offers an overview of recommended messaging tools based on the requirements listed above:

| **Tool** | **Open source** | **Default E2E** | **Group chat** |**Encryption protocol** | **Anonymous sign-up** | **Email sign-up** | **Phone sign-up** | **Self-destructing messages** | **Remote message deletion** | **Metadata Collection** | **Paid** | **Jurisdiction** | **Self-hosted** | **Usability** |

# VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORKS AND CIRCUMVENTION TOOLS

**WHAT**: A Virtual Private Network, or VPN, is a program that channels your device's internet connection through an encrypted "tunnel" which helps protect your privacy and security. A VPN can also allow you to access blocked content on your network.

**USEFUL FOR**: Protecting the privacy and security of your internet activity. Accessing blocked or censored content online.

**RECOMMENDED VPN SERVICE PROVIDERS**

Provider | Open source | Metadata collection | Anonymous sign in | Jurisdiction | Paid | Ease of use | Platform
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
[Mullvad](https://mullvad.net/en/) | Yes | No | Yes | Sweden | Yes | Good | Cross-platform
[Psiphon](https://psiphon.ca/) | Yes | No | Yes | - | Free | Good | iOS, Android, Windows


**LIMITS**: A VPN does NOT make you entirely anonymous. The services you sign on to on the internet can still figure out who you are. 
The use of a VPN does NOT eliminate the need for making sure that other security measures are in place to protect your devices and accounts.
